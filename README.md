# Piezomagnetic Simulation
A MATLAB simulation of the piezomagnetic effects due to seismic activity as presented in Sasai (1980)

## Getting Started

In order to run the simulation, the only requirement is a recent (2015 or later) version of MATLAB installed on your system. Simply clone the repository and load it into the MATLAB IDE. Then run `run_simulation.m` which will run the GUI to view the simulation.

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
